# BeginnerTicTacToe
Just my first shot at making a TicTacToe game. I did not include a score board. 
Does include a loop to allow continuous play until user says no to another match.
Not OOP.
Let me know if you have any suggestions or comments. I've tested it through, it shouldn't run into any errors.
